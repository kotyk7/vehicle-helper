# Hippisownia's Vehicle Helper Plugin

This plugins contains basic features and it's purpose is to interact with vehicles

Contains one basic command, /vehicleadmin <move/delete>  
For the subcommand move you need to provide a vector (x, y, z) and how much you want to move it in that direction  
The move subcommand is useful for getting the car easy without a carjack  

This was written to test my knowledge. Probably will add moving rotation later.
